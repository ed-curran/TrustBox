# Property Prepper

This is a simple demonstration site playing the role of a participant and credential issuer within [HomebuyingUK](../web/README.md).

Property prepper helps you obtain all the property data needed to ensure your property sale goes off smoothly.

It uses a free template available here: https://github.com/r1/nine4-3

And as usual, the trust backbone has been generated from a [trust model](../../packages/demo/README.md) using [TrustBench](../../packages/trustbench/README.md).
The property-prepper site maps to the `property-prepper` entity in the model.
